Build4_2
Creating file browser
Spec: create a file browser

Created JTree, with FileDisplay as nodes.  FileDisplay are class that take in File and have their own toString() method
which produces string of shortname.  getFile() retrieves the original file.
Nodes are created at start, with starting node of top = input "working directory" currently C:\\
And then the layer below also showing
Further children of nodes, are not created.
On clicking on a node (left hand click and mousepad click, one click) - highlights that node.
click lh click (and mousepad click), double click - this creates the next layer of nodes (of the children of that node)
If a node is "not a directory" - then dble clicking, lh mouse, on the node puts the file name into the text area at the bottom
Created a new renderer for the tree, to mean that directories show as differnt to files (as previously only showed as folders
if had already created and added the children to them, which was inefficient).

Added in popup menu which comes with a rightclick anywhere in JTree
